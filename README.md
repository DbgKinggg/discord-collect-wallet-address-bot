# üçö GohanGo!! Official Wallet Addresses Collector Discord Bot üçö

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh_Hans.md)

## ‚ùì What is this?

This is a Discord bot that is built to collect wallet address without disclosing your address to other members, with the following commands:

- `/address` show the current submitted address
- `/submit <address>` submit/replace wallet address in the database

The submitted address will also be validated to make sure only valid addresses are submitted.

## What technology/packages are being used?

- Node.js
- Discord.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- web3.js

## More functionality?

Yes! But for now collecting wallet addresses is what we need, we will add more useful functionality in the future

## How to use this in my own server?

### Create application and bot

You will have to create your own discord application and a bot first from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).

Once you are done, you need to invite your bot via the URL Generator (In the Developer Portal) with the right scope and permission.

Scope:

- Bot
- applications.commands

Permission:

- Send Messages

I recommend following this useful guide [here](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin).

### Set up project and environment variables

You will need to clone this repo to your local first, and then create a `.env` file in the root directory, and include the following variables:

- DISCORD_TOKEN (Can be obtained from Discord Developer Portal)
- GUILD_ID (Only needed in dev)
- ENV (production or development)
- MONGO_URL (the connection url that you can get on MongoDB)

You will also need to create your [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database (they have a free tier!) and obtain the connection url.

### Run the application

To run the application, you will need to `npm install` first and then run `node index.js` to start the bot, and the commands will be registered automatically on the discord server. Go test it out!
